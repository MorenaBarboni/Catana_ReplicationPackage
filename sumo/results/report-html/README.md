# SuMo - Report HTML
Report HTML provides a web view of the result generated during the sumo execution.

⚠️ **Important Note** <br>
In order to properly function, the **sumo folder must be hosted**. Several web servers can be used, such as Apache or Nginx; this guide will explain the use of Live Server, an extension of Visual Studio Code.

## Installation
The first step is to install the [Live Server](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ritwickdey.LiveServer) extension in VS Code if not already present; Once this is done, it will be necessary to configure some properties of the extension. It will then be necessary (if not present) to create a `settings.json` file in the `.vscode` folder at the **root of the project**. It will then be necessary to insert the following configuration into the file:

```bash
{
  /*
    This configuration prevents automatic page refresh that would otherwise cause visualisation problems.
  */
  "liveServer.settings.ignoreFiles": [
    "**/results/mutations.json",
    "**/results/report.txt",
    "**/results/mutants",
    "**/history",
    "**/baseline"
  ],
  /*
    This configuration sets the sumo folder as the only one to be hosted
  */
  "liveServer.settings.root": "/sumo"
}
```

## Usage
Once the Live Server extension has been installed and configured, the web server can be started. To do this, simply right-click on the file `/report-html/index.html` and select "Open with Live Server" from the menu. A web page of your default browser will automatically open with the reports generated by SuMo.

If the HTML report is opened before SuMo has finished running, the results generated up to that point will be displayed and the content of the page will be automatically updated whenever new data is available for display.
